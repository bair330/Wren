## Calculation Rules

### Streak Calculation
- Streak increments when user completes at least one session per day
- Streak resets to 0 if no session completed for 24+ hours
- Grace period: 2-hour buffer past midnight for late sessions

### Stress Improvement
- Calculated as: `pre_stress_level - post_stress_level`
- Positive values indicate improvement
- Averaged over rolling 7-day and 30-day windows

### Completion Rate
- `(completed_sessions / started_sessions) * 100`
- Sessions counted as "started" when user begins active meditation
- Sessions counted as "completed" when user reaches planned duration or manually ends with >50% completion
